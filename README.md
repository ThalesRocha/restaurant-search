#Restaurant search API

This application allows the user to check available restaurants based on up to 5 five criteria: name, distance, rating, price, and cuisine. I've built this project as a webserver because we can create a user interface in the future to improve the user experience.

I made some assumptions based on the assessment description:
The users must provide at least one criterion, but they can use up to five if they want.
Search by name and cuisine will return a response when it matches partial or exact.
We will handle the distance, price average, and rating as Integer values.
We have some limits for each field:
distance: 1 to 10
rating: 1 to 5
price: 10 to 50
We will always return the top five results if it's available and we will sort them by distance first, then high rating and last but not least lower price.

#Greetings

I pretty like did this assessment. I tried to use some design patterns and keep the code simple.
I'm going to appreciate it if you give your feedback on my implementation.

Thank you!
